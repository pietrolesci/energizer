# Installation

## Stable release

To install `energizer`, run this command in your
terminal:

```bash
pip install energizer
```

This is the preferred method to install `energizer`, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have [pip][] installed, this [Python installation guide][]
can guide you through the process.

## From source

The source for `energizer` can be downloaded from
the [Github repo][].

You can either clone the public repository:

```bash
git clone git://github.com/pietrolesci/energizer
```

Or download the [tarball][]:

```bash
curl -OJL https://github.com/pietrolesci/energizer/tarball/master
```

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

```bash
pip install .
```
